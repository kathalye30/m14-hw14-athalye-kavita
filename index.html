    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I work as the marketing communications manager at an indepdendent school, and oversee branding, digital and print design, photography, and website content management. I moved to India with my parents when I was in 5th grade and completed my middle and high school years there, and came back to the US for college and have been here since. I am a huge pet lover even though I don't any myself.</p>

        <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I enjoy reading, watching and listening to podcasts, and exploring smaller cities around me with friends. I also love to meet up with friends over sushi! I love spending my breaks and holidays visitng my parents back in India, or meeting up with them in a new country to explore.</p>

        <h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p>I'm relatively new in my current role having worked at a different school previously at the associate level. I actually studied Biology in college, so to make a total pivot from research to communications was initially difficult. My previous role allowed me to hone skills in graphic design, website management, social media management, and photography. I would love to continue focusing my career on digital branding.</p>
